{"id": "1231", "response": "<think>\nTo compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample, we need to consider the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy. Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas. The higher the temperature, the higher the average kinetic energy of the particles.\n\nThe average kinetic energy (KE) of a particle is given by the formula:\n\\[ KE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\]\nwhere \\( m \\) is the mass of the particle and \\( v \\) is its speed.\n\nGiven that both samples have the same number of particles and the same average particle speed (1,500 m/s), the sample with the higher mass per particle will have a higher average kinetic energy.\n\nSample A has particles with a mass of 17 u, while Sample B has particles with a mass of 28 u. Since Sample B has particles with a higher mass, it will have a higher average kinetic energy.\n\nTherefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.\n</think>\n<answer>\nB. sample B\n</answer>"}
